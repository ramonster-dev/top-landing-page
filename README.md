Warhammer 40k painting service theme for The Odin Project: Foundations landing page assignment.

Since I have been slowly reading more and more about Warhammer 40k and watching videos about its lore, I have been getting more and more tempted to get into the hobby. So, with the landing page template that has been provided by TOP, I wiil create a landing page for an imaginary busisness that allows you to purchase painting services for your armies no matter what faction you're playing as.

Listed below are the URL's for the assets that I used in the website. Give these guys some love!

Had a lot of fun creating this webpage and learned that positioning elements on the page with flexbox isn't as scary or absurd as I thought it was the first time I tried to learn how to use it. If I can do it, then you can do it too!
